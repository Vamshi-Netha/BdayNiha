Today is...
Your Birthday, But
I am the one
who should be 
celebrating the most
coz
You are my
favorite person on the Planet
Realizing another year
has gone by
it's simply not fair
That with you, I can't be there
To celebrate your special day
In the best possible way.
However...
Now things are different in lockdown
"May an adventure filled
year awaits you",
"have a prosperous and joyful  
year of your life",
Ila chepdam
wroth anipinchaledu
so,
Let me share...
a piece of happiness to you
na chitti burra nundi 
chitti kosam vachina 
chitti alochana tho
chesina chitti prayathnam edi...
as a Birthday present
Nachindaaa?
I wish to be beside you to see...
Expressions on your cute face
Chivaraga...
I'd like to wish you one more time
a very happy birthday Jumbarthi Niharika
